\begin{subsectionframemod}{Difference between Natural and Aerial Images}
    Most methods are evaluated on natural images: Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets. 
    $\Rightarrow$ this does not guarantee good performance on aerial images. 
    \vspace{2mm}

    Objects' sizes are extremely different between aerial and natural images.
