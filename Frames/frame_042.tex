     Let us introduce some notations.

     We denote by $\mathcal{F}_c$ and $\mathcal{F}_r$ the sub-models responsible for classification and regression respectively:

    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{F}_c &= f_c \circ f, \\
        \mathcal{F}_r &= f_r \circ f, \\
        \text{with } f &= f^{L-1} \circ f^{L-2} \circ \dots \circ f^1.
    \end{align}

     To leverage DiffusionDet in the few-shot regime, we propose to adopt a Transfer Learning approach.
     Once, the model is base-trained, it is prepared for fine-tuning.

     A large part of the model is frozen.
     The crucial part is that we can finely control the amount of frozen layers with a hyperparameter $\gamma$.

    Denoting frozen layers with a bar (\eg $\overline{f^1}$), the frozen detection model is expressed as

    \begin{equation}
        f = f^L \circ \dots \circ f^{\gamma+1} \circ \overline{f^\gamma} \circ \dots \circ \overline{f^1}.
        \label{eq:frezze}
    \end{equation}
