    Impossible to compare performance on different datasets. However, it is
    possible to \alert{compare FSOD performance against non few-shot baseline} and
    compare this across several datasets.

    Large size discrepencies between average class size suggests analyzing performance
    per class. \alert{Clear correlation between average class size and performance} compared to baseline.
