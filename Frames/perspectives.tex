\begin{subsectionframemod}{Conclusion}
\textbf{This analysis of the freezing point is a first in the FSOD domain and should be extended as future work.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Here it is a \bfalert{hyperparameter}, we can expect to find a criteria to find it \bfalert{automatically} according to datasets and model.
    \item[-] This idea could be expanded to \bfalert{cross-domain} tasks by identifying the base dataset that yields the best results for our target dataset.
\end{itemize}
